      <div class="dis disability">
       <p> Disability Awareness means educating people regarding disabilities and giving people the knowledge
         required to carry out a job or task, thus separating good practice from poor. It is no longer enough just to know 
         that disability discrimination is unlawful. Disability etiquette is guidelines dealing specifically with how to 
         approach people with disabilities 
        and were initially created to challenge social conventions rather than to reinforce them.

            Keeping in view, the rising number of crimes against girls in the country, it is important to provide self-defence 
            training to them in the schools to ensure their safety and security. Self-defence training is a life skill that helps girls 
            to be more aware of their surroundings and be prepared for the unexpected at any time.Under the Scheme, Self-defense training 
            is provided for three months per Government schools.The girls are trained to use every day articles such as, Key chain, duppata,
          
        Stole, mufflers, bags, pen/ pencil, notebook etc. as weapons.</p>
