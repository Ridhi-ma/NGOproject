            Nature has an important part in everybody’s life, to make such practical knowledge accessible to
            rural children , this programme was started on 2nd December 2021. Workers from our NGO
            volunteered to go to certain villages 
            and teach children about things which are not emphasized upon
            in the government schools.

            Another such programme was conducted a month later, on 2nd January 2022, where children from
            different places were taught things in many ways i.e, theoretical and practical knowledge and were
            provided with proper meals.

            A recent awareness programme that was held on 24th march, was about spreading awareness of
health of the children and women. Women were given proper information about their personal
hygiene and how they can keep their children away from fatal diseases as well.
